## About me

I am ambitious juinior backend developer, that most sutisfying thing to me is to bring my own ideas to life with no afraid of changing direction if its necessary.

I've started to learn some basic stuff in programming when I was 16 and really loved the concept of automizing tasks without the need of materials except from the laptop and a decent internet connection.

## Projects

I did some intresting project in my college attendncy, which was to render 3D objects on the screen which included many linear algebra equations and Java knowledge. There is also telegram bots and exchange api wrappers for cryptoexchanges but never saw them as a complete project.

For now I'm working on some cloud microservices project that I suppose will be interesting at the time I'll finnish it.

#### My Top Languages ðŸ˜¶

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=menahem-mendel&layout=compact&theme=vision-friendly-dark)

##### My first programming langauge ðŸŒ›
>For me C language have a special place in my list, It is the first language that I've started to learn and felt like I could write some basic programs on the terminal. The first book that I've rad about programming was The C Programming Language by Kernighan & Ritchie. From C I moved on to C++ as a more featureich alternative.
##### Most loved programming language ðŸ¤Ÿ
>I am very excited about Go language, It's fast as a whole not just performant, but in development too. And first book in this language was ofc The Go Programming Language by Kernighan & Donovan and some other good books too. It is a nice language for some tasks, the concurrent mechanisms just works, and simplicity of it - the main point of its existence.
##### No from me, but sometimes I need it ðŸ˜¥
>Every language has it's pros & cons, but I find python as worst alternative for Go in potential. I didn't liked it because of its syntax and slow execution time. Probably I will return to it in some point but for now my opinion remains.
